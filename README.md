# gracey

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


### NOTE:
To develop in macos, ensure that `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` has `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` set to false. By default, macos sandboxes applications which does not allow the application to issue docker commands.
